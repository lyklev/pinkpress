Introduction
------------

Pinkpress is a super-simple system for managing content (for example, a blog)
on minimal hardware. It does this using Blogger-style, that is, formatting
HTML once to create static pages offline.


Installation
------------

Because this system is to run on a Raspberry Pi, the installation instructions
are for a fresh install on Raspbian with no additional packages.

The following packages are needed:

The web server:

* apache2
